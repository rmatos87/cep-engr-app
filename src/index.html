          <h2><strong>In my spare time…</strong></h2>
         <p>Who doesn’t love a good book? I do! Guilty! I love reading and after a day at work nothing relaxes me more than reading! It’s also a must to have every time I travel – to kill time on the plane! By the way, one thing you should know about me is that I HATE flying! so I  need some distraction. What am I reading at the moment you ask? The Husband’s Secret, a novel by Liane Moriarty. 
         </p>
         <p>Although I hate flying, I love travelling and get to see new countries, meet new people and try many different foods. I love eating and discovering other cultures. I am going to Japan and the Philippines this year, so I am very excited (and scared at the same time as it will be a long flight!). </p>
         <p>Another passion of mine is walking, particularly long walks…What about a walk in a park? Well, in London I can still do that although the weather is not always the most inviting to leave the house. However, a nice walk in the woodland of Surrey is one of my favourite things to do during the weekends.</p>
         <p>To finish (I can’t list all, unfortunately!) I love movies. Watching movies while I’m cosy at home or going to the cinema, it doesn’t matter! A good movie is always a good movie. My favourite movie? I don’t think I have a favourite one, as long as it’s good, I’m in!</p>

      <h2><strong>My work…</strong></h2>
      <p>I’m an Engagement Manager in Homeaway. Say what? OK, I will try to explain what I do. I manage projects while I keep the customers engaged so they can complete those projects. It seems boring, right? Not at all! I love what I do and almost every day I have a new challenge (which I love challenges, remember?) so no day is like the other!</p>

        <h2><strong>My family and Friends…</strong></h2>
       <p>My family and friends are my world! My family is the best! We are a big family, my parents, two sisters and a brother. I already have 3 nieces and 1 nephew, they make Christmas magical and I love them to bits! I miss them though as they all live in Portugal; however, I try to visit them as much as I can and thankfully to modern technologies, I can always call them and have video-calls.</p>
       <p>My friends live in different countries, which I find very handy as it’s always a good excuse to visit my friends and travel to different places. Most of my friends live in Portugal though, but again, I do go to Portugal often to visit my family.</p>

        <h2><strong>My mantras…</strong></h2>
       <p>My personal mantra is: JUST DO IT, do not procrastinate! I try to follow this mantra every day and, guess what? I think it’s working well for me!</p>
       <p>Other mantras that I try to follow:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Be with those who bring out the best in you, not the <em>stress</em> in you</li>
           <li>May my heart be kind, my mind fierce and my spirit brave</li>
           <li>Create a life you can be proud of</li>
